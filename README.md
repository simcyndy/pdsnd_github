# Bike Share System Project

## Overview
Explore and analyze data associated with bike share systems across three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The project delves into descriptive statistical analysis to uncover trends and insights. Through a script, users are able to interact with the data in a terminal, providing a dynamic exploration experience.
